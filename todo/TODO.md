# TODO

- [ ] Try Track A from `initial_plan.md`: run LeRobot + pi0 (flow) on LIBERO in headless mode on this 8xH100 environment and capture reproducible eval commands and results ([plan](todo/20260210-track-a-lerobot-pi0-libero.md))
  - [ ] Create the `vla_pi0` environment and install LeRobot with `.[libero]`.
  - [ ] Run a small then scaled headless `lerobot-eval` with `lerobot/pi0_libero_finetuned`, using 8xH100 capacity where practical.
  - [ ] Record success rate plus log/video artifact paths for later file download.
